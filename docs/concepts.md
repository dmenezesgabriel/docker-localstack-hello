# Concepts

## Fault Tolerance

Built-in redundancy is the core principle of fault tolerance. The system is designed to continue operating even if one or more of its components fail. The system is able to continue operating at a partial capacity if a partial failure occurs. The system is able to recover fully if a full failure occurs.

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability to accommodate larger load by making the hardware stronger(scale up), or by adding more hardware nodes(scale out).

## Elasticity

Elasticity is the ability to scale up or down based on the load. This is usually done by adding or removing nodes to the system.

## Agility

New IT resources are only one click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.

## High Availability

High availability is the ability of a system to remain operational even if some of its components fail. The system is able to continue operating at a full capacity if a partial failure occurs. The system is able to recover fully if a full failure occurs.
