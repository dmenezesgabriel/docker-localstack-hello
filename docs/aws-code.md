## AWS Code Commit

Code commit is a version control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. Code commit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use Code commit to securely store anything from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.

## AWS Code Build

Code build is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With Code build, you don't need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. Code build scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build tools. With Code build, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources you use.

## AWS Code Deploy

Code deploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. Code deploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. You can use Code deploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one instance or thousands.
