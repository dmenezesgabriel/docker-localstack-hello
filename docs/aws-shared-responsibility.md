# Shared Responsibility Model

> You can think of this model as being similar to the division of responsibilities between a homeowner and a homebuilder. The builder (AWS) is responsible for constructing your house and ensuring that it is solidly built. As the homeowner (the customer), it is your responsibility to secure everything in the house by ensuring that the doors are closed and locked. Pratictioner, skill builder

## Description

The shared responsibility model is a security framework that defines the security responsibilities of AWS and its customers. The model is designed to help clarify which security tasks are the responsibility of AWS and which are the responsibility of the customer. The shared responsibility model is applicable to all AWS services except Amazon Lightsail, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones.
