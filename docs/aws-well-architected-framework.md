### Operational Excellence

Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Design Principles:

- Perform operations as code
- Annotate documentation
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure

### Security

Security is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

### Performance Efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### Cost Optimization

Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### Sustainability

Sustainability is the ability to design, deploy, and operate systems that deliver business value and continue to meet requirements as the business evolves.
