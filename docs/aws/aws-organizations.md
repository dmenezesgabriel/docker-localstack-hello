# AWS Organizations

## Description

AWS organizations are used to manage multiple AWS accounts. They can be used to group accounts, apply policies to accounts, and automate account creation.

## Features

- Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts
- Consolidated billing
- Service control policies

### Service control policies

Service control policies (SCPs) are used to control what services and actions can be used in an account. They can be used to restrict access to services and actions that are not needed in an account. SCPs can be applied to accounts and organizational units (OUs).

## Organizational units

Organizational units (OUs) are used to group accounts. They can be used to apply SCPs to multiple accounts at once.

## Benefits

You can get discounts on AWS services by using consolidated billing. You can also get volume discounts on AWS support plans.
