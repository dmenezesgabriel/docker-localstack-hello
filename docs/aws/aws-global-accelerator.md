# AWS Global accelerator

## Description

AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances.

## Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

CloudFront is a content delivery network to cache content at the edge and global accelerator is to make your request go faster and go through the internal AWS network globally.
