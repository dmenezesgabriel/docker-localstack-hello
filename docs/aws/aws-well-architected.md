# AWS Well Architected

## Description

AWS Well Architected is a framework to help customers build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — AWS Well Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time.

## Pillars

### Operational Excellence

The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include managing and automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to successfully manage daily operations.

### Security

The security pillar focuses on protecting information & systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what with privilege management, protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.

### Reliability

The reliability pillar focuses on ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. Key topics include foundational elements around setup, cross project requirements, recovery planning, and how we handle change.

### Performance Efficiency

The performance efficiency pillar focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently. Key topics include selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve.

### Cost Optimization

The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding un-needed costs. Key topics include understanding and controlling where money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
