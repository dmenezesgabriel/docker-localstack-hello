# Serverless

## Description

Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore, they just deploy code.

- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc."
- Serverless dows not mean there are no servers, it means you just don't manage / provision / see them
